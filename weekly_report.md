- Week - 1 (May 18 - 22)
  - GitHub milestone
  - Task Reflection 
    - Glance at PyCall 
      - There are different ways to wrap Python code.
      - Some do's and don'ts (can be found on Readme of pkg)
      - Tricks to speed up the Python <-> Julia calls.
      - How to pass the streaming IO to python via Julia?
    - Glance at SciKitLearn 
      - This Pkg is one of the good examples of how to wrap the library.
      - Checked code changes with commit history.
      - Developed an overall understanding of pkg workflow.
      - How SciKitLearnBase help SciKitLearn?
    - The way MLJModels uses ScikitLearn
      - The way module import and Pkg dependency work?
    - Data Container
      - we can use TimeSeries for classification.
      - JuliaDB has mutable struct and overall should work fine.
    - Reading the MLJ paper for Interface.
      - The APIs Interface in MLJ is great and we can follow the style.
  - Deliverable & Task completed 
    - API wiki document.
    - Reading issue #2 & #1 on MLJTime.

- Week - 2 (May 25 - 29)
  - GitHub milestone
  - Task Reflection
    - Use of MLJ vs small pkgs for basic algorithms.
      - Predicting single instance vs multiple instalce at same time in decesion tress.
      - How do we tunen in mix of julia and puython objects. 
    - Tables can't handel ND objects.
      - We have to create Array(matrix) every time as input to algorithms. 
    - train and test splits.
      - Do we use sktime ts way to store data or csv.
      - Can we put in train and test in single file and finally split before fit or predict.
  - Deliverable & Task completed 
    - Julia implementation of tsf is complete. 
    - Ipython notebook of tsf over gunpoint dataset.
    - Functionality of ready to load data in MLJtime.
